So much fun playing with Model Predictive Control!

And Python. Interested? ðŸ‘‡

My problem has always been that there are many libraries that show how MPC works and assist you in the test.

However, there's little freedom to implement the algorithm in a way that can be easily ported on a microcontroller.

MPC is based on the minimisation of a cost function, so I always wanted to implement it using a minimisation function, not a specific MPC library.

Finally, I had some time to play and got a working example.

Let's see! ðŸ‘‡

The picture below shows a recap of the pendulum dynamics and its differential equation:

The plant used is a pendulum, with the following dynamic equation:

ddtheta_ddt = (tau - m\*g\*l\*sin(theta) - k\*dtheta_dt) / (m\*l^2)

To formulate the MPC algorithm, we need the system in the discrete-time form:

âœ… ddtheta_ddt = (tau - m\*g\*l\*sin(theta) - k\*dtheta_dt)/(m\*l^2)
âœ… dtheta_dt = dtheta_dt + ddtheta_ddt\*dt
âœ… theta = theta + dtheta_dt\*dt

where dt is our time step.

Now the cost function.

I included a term that considers the angular speed too, so:

J = sum[ Q11\*dtheta_dt(i)^2 + Q22\*(theta_ref(i) - theta(i))^2 + R\*tau(i)^2]

Also, I thought of two logical constraints for the torque control sequence:

âœ… Max torque: -tau_max < tau(i) < tau_max
âœ… Torque rate of change: -delta_tau_max < tau(i+1) - tau(i) < delta_tau_max

Have a look at the code (link to GitHub in the comments) to see how the second constraint is implemented, I think it's interesting!

This is how the control algorithm works:

âœ… The function mpc_cost computes J for the next N (20) steps, starting from the current state
âœ… The function solve_mpc sets the constraints and bounds and uses scipy.optimize.minimize to minimise the cost computed by mpc_cost and then returns the optimal control input sequence

The code implements a simulation of the loop for 10 seconds, where the setpoint is 180 deg for the first 5 seconds and 90 deg from 5s to 10s.

The prediction horizon of 20 steps corresponds to 2 seconds with the dt = 0.1s that I used.

I used comments to show the separation between the simulation code and the control code (which should be implemented on a microcontroller for real-world operation).

Have a look at the simulation result, I find it interesting how different the response is with respect to a linear controller.

It is clear that the control algorithm "knows" what's going to happen next!

This is a simple first example, I plan to use this approach in many others.
